## Torn rules

Scripting ABUSE:
> The use of scripts, extensions, applications or any other kind of software is allowed only if it uses data from our API or a page you have loaded manually and are currently viewing. They cannot make additional non-API requests to Torn, scrape pages that you're not currently viewing, or attempt to bypass the captcha. If the software you're using makes non-API requests that are not manually triggered by you, it is not allowed and can be tracked. Furthermore, releasing software which has malicious or undisclosed abilities is forbidden

Real Money trading:
> The exchange of currency or assets on Torn for real-world money or services (including assets from other games) is strictly prohibited. Real money trading directly affects Torn's economy and donation levels, while exposing our users to fraudulent activities. Staff proactively seek out buyers and sellers both on-site and externally, and no warnings are given for the first offense. Buyers will have their purchased goods removed and be subject to a lengthy game ban, whereas sellers will be banned permanently without recourse.
